# Rebalance channels with an emphasis on pushing sats OUT of channels that are low to zero fee
# to all channels that need more outbound liquidity
# unlike lndg rebalance, this script uses rebalance-lnd and balanceofsatoshis to find the best channels
# and it runs through every single pairing to ensure that every option is tried.
# Note that there is no preferential order to which source is used first for a given sink.
# this script was written for the love of testing and is not something you may want to actually run
# unless you really know what you are doing

# additional note: it would perform MUCH faster to write a purpose-built Node.js app using the lightning.proto but 
# rebalance-lnd and bos are already out of the box so I'm not going to bother with that as this is just POC
# a Node.js app could run parallel threads and have reporting/etc (maybe later)

# EDIT CONFIGS BELOW BEFORE RUNNING

# SINKS: channels with high inbound liquidity (75%+)
# SOURCES: channels with high outbound (75%+) + low fee (e.g. under 100 PPM)

# attempt to rebalance from every single SOURCE to every single SINK
# doubling the amount on success until it fails
# WARNING: this does not stop if the route succeeds 
# so it could excessively rebalance a channel in to close to 100%

# example
# sudo ./balance.sh
# or only target a single channel by id
# this will use every SOURCE to rebalance this single target chanid 
# sudo ./balance.sh $TARGET
# note: if you don't require sudo for docker, you can skip the sudo
# and set USER to USER=$(whoami)
